    Also, the `get_prologue_text` method is overwritten here to be able print out extra info
    in the prologue before the menu items. The information printed is stored variables (that the
    user has selected) as well as any warnings. Since menus can open submenus, the submenus get the
    options of the parent menus, and the submenus can also add their own options.

    For example the pointsdirectory menu can be used to select a folder which is in the structure
    of a `PointsDirectory`. Then a submenu can be used and it will remember the chosen folder in the parent
    directory. Also, this submenu can put in its own options (which will be displayed in the prolog
    along with the parent options and any warnings).
