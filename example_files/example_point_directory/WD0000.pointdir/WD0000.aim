Sum of MO Occupancies                       =  2.00000000E+01
Analytically integrated number of electrons =  2.00000000E+01
Maximum deviation from 1 for diagonal of MO overlap matrix =  1.59543172E-08 (MO 4)

The calculation of Vee(A) and Vee(A,A) can be very time-consuming!

For post-HF wavefunctions (e.g., CISD, MP2, CCSD, etc.), Vee(A) and Vee(A,A) are calculated from an approximation of the 2-EDM in terms of the 1-EDM.

For wavefunctions of supported DFT models (currently LSDA, B3LYP, M062X, PBE and PBE0), corresponding model-specific exchange-correlation energy functional contributions are calculated.  However, for wavefunctions of non-supported DFT models, the Hartree-Fock model is assumed.

 AIMExt is a heavily modified and extended version of the EXTREME program
 developed by members of R.F.W. Bader's research group

 Much of the Quantum Theory of Atoms in Molecules (QTAIM) is described in the book:
   "Atoms in Molecules - A Quantum Theory"
   R.F.W. Bader, Oxford University Press, Oxford, 1990

 Using MO basis.

 Number of processors used for this job =    2

 Analyzing Rho, the electron density


Total number of electron density critical points found =     11

Calculating ESP values at 11 critical points:
      ...........

Number of NACPs  =      6
Number of NNACPs =      0
Number of BCPs   =      5
Number of RCPs   =      0
Number of CCPs   =      0
NumNACP + NumNNACP - NumBCP + NumRCP - NumCCP =      1
Poincare-Hopf Relationship is Satisfied

 Total time for electron density critical point search, analysis and connectivity = 4 sec (NProc = 2)
