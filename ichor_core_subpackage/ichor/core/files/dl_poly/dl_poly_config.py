        .. note::
            ALL of the timesteps in the Trajectory will be written to one
            CONFIG file. Each timestep groups geometries which should be
            represented by a GP model. For example, if each timestep is
            only one molecule, then it means it is a monomer model and the
            labels of the atoms in the CONFIG will show that. If each timestep
            is two molecules, it means it is a dimer model, so then the
            labels in the CONFIG file will make sure that two molecules
            which should be represented by one GP model have the correct atom labeling
            in the CONFIG file.
